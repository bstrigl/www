What is UX writing?
===================

UX writing is the practices of creating text that users see in the interface of a software, e.g. buttons, labels, in-field tooltips, error messages, etc - i.e. all the copy that guides users through the product. This texts is often referred to as “microcopy”.

“It’s about designing the conversation between a product and its user. [...] Many of the things that make UX writing good are the things that make other writing good too: clarity, consistency, precision, self-awareness, a whole lot of revision, and thoughtful attention to the context and the audience.”
